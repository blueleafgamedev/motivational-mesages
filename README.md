## **What is this program?**
---------------------------

This program was my first portfolio project for the Full Stack Engineer career path on Codecademy.
It was originally named mixed-messages, but I chose to call it motivational messages.

## **What does it do?**
----------------------

My program greets me, tells me the date and time, and then gives me a daily question, daily goal idea, and a daily POWER STATEMENT. I really wanted to promote positivity with this program because programming can be difficult. Not to mention, there is a lot of deep thought involved. All three of these messages that I receive after the initial greeting provoke deep thought and this is exactly what I wanted.

## **How do I use it?**
----------------------

An idea I have is to have this script run every time I open git, as an initial brain charge and motivator. I am still working on this part, but I am pretty sure I will figure it out soon. Once I do, I will place an update in this file and you can feel free to use it the same way I do or customize it to suit your needs! You can also feel free to change up any of the code to suit your needs! Let me know what you think!
