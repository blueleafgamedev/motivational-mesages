# READ ME FIRST!

## **What is this program?**

This program was my first portfolio project for the Full Stack Engineer career path on Codecademy.
It was originally named mixed-messages, but I chose to call it motivational messages.

## **What does it do?**

My program greets me with a good morning, good afternoon, or good evening (dependint on the time of day) and then gives me a daily question, daily goal idea, and a daily POWER STATEMENT. I really wanted to promote positivity with this program because programming can be difficult. Not to mention, there is a lot of deep thought involved. All three of these messages that I receive after the initial greeting provoke deep thought and this is exactly what I wanted.

## **How to use it?**

I added this to my ~/.bashrc file so that it loads everytime I start my terminal. I did this by using node and its absolute path. If you would like to do this too, just use $ realpath filename.js to locate the entire path to your file. You can then add it to your ~/.bashrc by using the following command: echo "node filePath" >> ~/.bashrc. For example, I added mine like this echo "node /home/travis/Projects/motivational-messages/script.js" >> ~/.bashrc

If you need any help, please don't hesitate to reach out! Also, feel free to modify the code to suit your needs :)


Below is an example of how the program looks from my terminal :)
